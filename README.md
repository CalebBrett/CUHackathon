# PoliSpace
By Jonathan Steeves and Caleb Brett

## Goal and needs of users

The goal of this project was to increase viewership, engagement, and participation at political events. We chose this because political events like debates or rallies often are not engaging to the viewer, particularly younger audiences.

There is a need by event organizers and political officials to be able to have a platform where they can communicate and gain feedback from the audience. As well as having a way to engage the audience to keep them watching the main event for longer. 
On the other hand, there is a need by the audience to interact with the officials and open a line of communication with them. This is important in politics because most people feel like the only way they can contribute to politics is by voting or by becoming a politician themselves.

## Tools used
- React was used to build the webapp
- Google cloud was used to host the webapp and SQL server
- Domain.com used to make the domain name
- Bootstrap
- NewsAPI was used to get an RSS feed of political questions (this cant be demonstrated because we didn't have enough time to figure out how to parse the json file)

## Challenges
- We ran into problems integrating the SQL server for the backend, so we had to leave that out.
- We had trouble hosting the website with google cloud and a custom domain, but we figured it out in the end.
- The RSS feed API was a challenge to add also in the end we added it but were unable to use it because we could not parse the JSON file.

## Extra features/Future improvements
- Create a game for the users where they can compete for prizes set by the organizer, maybe like meeting with some of the political officials.
